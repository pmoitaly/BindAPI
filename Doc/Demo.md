# BindAPI: demo

Some demo showing how to use BindAPI are available in the library repository on Github.

## BindApiSimpleDemo

That demo uses the simple case of Autobinding - i.e. a class binds itself. We use here almost all elements in BindAPI, to perform 

- the connection between two classes;
- simple binding and with property paths and fields;
- the use of data conversion functions;
- method binding.

VCL and FMX versions of the demo are available. Please, note that they share the same business logic in the common unit _Test.Controller.pas_.


The demo will be updated now and then to use new features of the library.
