# BindAPI: demo

Some demo showing how to use BindAPI are - or will be - available in the \\Demo folder.

## BindApiSimpleDemo

That demo uses the simple case of Autobinding - i.e. a class binds itself. We use here almost all elements in BindAPI, to perform 

- the connection between two classes;
- simple binding and with property paths and fields;
- the use of data conversion functions;
- method binding.

There is a monitor form to see registered binder, classes and the error list.

VCL and FMX versions of the demo will be available. Please, note that they share the same business logic in the common unit _Test.Controller.pas_.



The demo set will be updated to show new features of the library.
