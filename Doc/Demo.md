# BindAPI: demo

A small demo showing how to use BindAPI is available in the library repository on Github. It is a very simple but quite complete example, showing:

- the connection between two classes;
- simple binding and with property paths and fields;
- the use of data conversion functions;
- method binding.

The demo will be updated from time to time to explain new library features.
