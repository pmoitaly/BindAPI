# BindAPI requirements

BindAPI requirements are very light, as they are reduced to the Delphi compiler only.

## Current version (0.8 beta)


BindAPI requires Embarcadero Delphi 10.3 Rio. It could work with previous versions of Delphi.

Currently BindAPI is being tested under Windows 10 with 32 and 64 bit applications. The current version is to be considered a preview, mature enough but not yet suitable for real applications.

## Future versions

There is not a precise roadmap, but some goals of future releases are:

- Support for Collections and Arrays.
- Compatibility with FreePascal Compiler and Lazarus.
- Checking for compatibility with Android 32 and 64 bit.
- Compatibility with Delphi 10.2 and previous edition.

## Limitations

- BindAPI is not yet suitable for applications that require real-time responses.
- BindAPI is based on the assumption that no property is of record type.
- Fields support is still under development.
