# BindAPI General Requirements

BindAPI requirements are very light, as they are reduced to the Delphi compiler only. No 3rd-party libraries required, just RTL. 

## Current Version (0.9 alpha)

BindAPI is implemented with Embarcadero Delphi 12.1 CE. It could work with previous versions of Delphi.

At present BindAPI is being tested under Windows 11 with the following targets:

| Target platform | Compiled   | Tested      | Demo       |
| --------------- | ---------- | ----------- |----------- |
| Win32           | Yes        | Yes         | Yes        |
| Win64           | Yes        | Yes         | Yes        |
| Android 32      | Yes        | No          | No         |
| Android 64      | Yes        | No          | No         |

The current version is still to be considered a preview, mature enough but not yet suitable for real applications.
