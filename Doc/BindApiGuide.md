#BindAPI quick guide

BindAPI is an open source library for Delphi that allows you to link the properties and fields of any class using attributes. Its simplicity and its versatility make it the ideal tool to create prototypes, demos, POCs and small applications by applying the separation of logic and presentation from the first steps.

The characteristics of BindAPI are:

- Lightness. The classes to be added to an application are few and of very limited weight.
- Compatibility. It does not require the modification of any existing library and is designed to implement the most common architectural patterns, such as MVC, MVP, MVVM and their variants.
- Simplicity. It is possible to link the properties of any object using only one attribute, or a line of code for each binding.

 **Note**: due to the coronavirus emergency, which made the prospects for the near future uncertain, BindAPI was released earlier than the original plans, so the first versions will not be complete. 
 A description of the reasons that led to the writing of BindAPI and its characteristics compared to more famous tools is also being prepared.
